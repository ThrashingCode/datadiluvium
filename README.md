# NOTES - Relaunching Project & Project Cleanup

Heyo all interested, I'm currently in the process of clean up on this repo and also getting everybody looped into the project that is interested in being directly involved. To get involved, sign up to [Thrashing Code News](https://adron.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7f73ff0427183b9b64e1f336a&id=a6fc3efde0) and select the *Open Source Projects Only* option.

More to come *REALLY REALLY REALLY* soon!  :-)
